üìè Architecture & System Design - Job Importer with Queue Processing & History Tracking.

This document describes the architecture, technology choices, and system behavior of the Job Importer, a scalable background job ingestion system.


üìä High-Level Overview

The system is designed to fetch jobs from multiple external XML feeds, convert and queue them, process them asynchronously, store them in MongoDB, and maintain import logs. A frontend dashboard provides visibility into the import history.


Core Capabilities:

Scheduled job fetching (via cron)

Background queue processing (via Redis + BullMQ)

MongoDB persistence for job data and logs

Admin dashboard to view import history
